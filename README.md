# ECE387-MID

My design is imitating parking by using IR senior. The distance between the car and the wall is measured by IR Senior. If the distance between the car and the wall is less than 30cm, the red light will go on. If not, the green light is on. Sensor parameter is Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F. It consists of three parts: PSD (position sensitive detector), IRED (infrared emitting diode) and signal processing circuit.
